## 👠 **FashionFit Palette: AI-Based Outfit Color Analyzer & Suggestor**

### 🎯 Project Overview:

**FashionFit Palette** helps users analyze outfit colors from uploaded images and get AI-based suggestions for complementary items (shoes, bags, accessories) based on fashion aesthetics and color theory. It also recommends the best seasons to wear the outfit.

---

### ✅ Key Features:

1. **Upload Outfit Photo**

   * User uploads a fashion image.
   * Extracts dominant colors from the outfit using clustering (K-Means).

2. **Color Harmony Suggestions**

   * Suggests complementary colors based on fashion color theory (e.g., analogous, complementary).
   * Recommends matching accessories, shoes, or jackets.

3. **Season Suitability**

   * Based on extracted color palette, suggests suitable seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter).

4. **AI-Generated Fashion Tip**

   * Generates a short AI fashion tip or blog caption based on colors.

5. **Downloadable Palette**

   * Users can download their color palette as an image or JSON file.

### 💡 Example Use Case:

> You upload a photo of a pastel dress — it detects soft pinks and blues, suggests white/gold accessories, a light denim jacket, and recommends wearing it in spring. It also writes a cute Instagram caption like:
> *"Spring vibes in soft hues 💗👗 Time to twirl into sunshine!"*
